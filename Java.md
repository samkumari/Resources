 ## 🚀 Kick-off your Java Journey

Congratulations on choosing to start your journey into the world of **Java Programming** ☕.  
This roadmap, although it focuses on **Core Java** in general, is highly oriented toward building a **solid foundation** for software development. Keep that in mind as you navigate through the roadmap — there are several other paths you can explore once you’re comfortable (frameworks, backend, Android, etc.).

> 💡 **Energy and persistence conquer all things.**

Remember, great things take time.  
This roadmap has been carefully curated to cover the most essential Java topics — from syntax and OOP to collections, streams, and beyond. If it feels overwhelming at any point, take a breather and come back refreshed.  
Your **hard work will definitely pay off**! 💯

##  Prerequisites

Before diving into the challenge, ensure you have Java installed on your system.

-  **Install the latest JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
  [![How to Install Java on Your PC](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IJ-PJbvJBGs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ-PJbvJBGs)  
-  A good code editor like **IntelliJ IDEA**, **VS Code**, or **Eclipse**  
  >  *We suggest using **VS Code** for a smooth and lightweight Java development experience.*  
-  Basic understanding of how to navigate your operating system (creating folders, opening terminals, etc.)
